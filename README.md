# urban-air-quality-kg

## Overview

This project provides a semantically enriched **Knowledge Graph (KG)** for exploring urban air quality phenomena and associated mitigation measures. It leverages **Neo4j** for graph management, **SentenceTransformers** for embedding generation, and a **local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** powered by a locally hosted large language model (LLM), enabling users to query and interact with air quality data in natural language.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Knowledge Graph Storage:** Uses Neo4j for storing and managing structured data about pollutants, pollution sources, meteorological factors, and mitigation measures.
- **Semantic Embeddings:** Employs SentenceTransformers to embed KG nodes semantically, enabling effective similarity searches.
- **Local RAG Pipeline:** Integrates a locally hosted large language model using Llama.cpp for natural language querying and information retrieval from the KG.
