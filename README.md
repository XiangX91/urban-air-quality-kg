# Enhancing Urban Air Quality Understanding with Knowledge Graphs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Overview

This project provides a semantically enriched **Knowledge Graph (KG)** for exploring urban air quality phenomena and associated mitigation measures. It leverages **Neo4j** for graph management, **SentenceTransformers** for embedding generation, and a **local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** powered by a locally hosted large language model (LLM), enabling users to query and interact with air quality data in natural language.

---

## Features

- **Knowledge Graph Storage:** Uses Neo4j for storing and managing structured data about pollutants, pollution sources, meteorological factors, and mitigation measures.
- **Semantic Embeddings:** Employs SentenceTransformers to embed KG nodes semantically, enabling effective similarity searches.
- **Local RAG Pipeline:** Integrates a locally hosted large language model using Llama.cpp for natural language querying and information retrieval from the KG.

## Functions provided

### Python Scripts in src/

**Each script in the src/ directory serves a specific function:**

* neo4j_embedding_pipeline.py: Generates semantic embeddings for nodes in the Neo4j Knowledge Graph using SentenceTransformers and stores them within the graph.
* neo4j_similarity_search.py: Performs semantic similarity searches within the Neo4j KG, allowing retrieval of semantically related entities based on user queries.
* neo4j_local_rag.py: Implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using local embeddings and a local Large Language Model (LLM) via Llama.cpp, enabling natural-language question answering using the knowledge graph.
* neo4j_import.py: Handles the ingestion of extracted JSON into the Neo4j KG, mapping raw data into the predefined graph schema.
* extraction.py: Extracts structured information explicitly from unstructured text documents using Large Language Models (LLMs) guided by a predefined ontology, converting the extracted data into structured JSON format suitable for graph integration.
* json_validator.py: Validates JSON data explicitly to ensure all entities and relationships conform to the project's ontology schema, confirming correctness and consistency before importing into the Neo4j KG.
* merge_knowledge.py: Explicitly merges new knowledge extracted from text into the existing structured JSON knowledge base, resolving duplicates and conflicts using fuzzy matching to maintain data integrity.

**The Jupyter notebooks in the notebook/ demonstrate how to utilise the above scripts:**

* Knowledge extraction: Demonstrates how to extract structured knowledge from raw text documents using the extraction.py script, creating structured JSON outputs guided by the project's ontology.
* Knowledge enrich and validation: Illustrates how to merge and validate extracted knowledge with existing structured datasets using merge_knowledge.py and jsonvalidator.py, ensuring data quality and consistency.
* Knowledge embedding and preparation: A step-by-step guide on generating embeddings and performing semantic similarity searches within the Neo4j KG.
* Natural Language Q&A via Local RAG Pipeline: Demonstrates how to use the local RAG pipeline to answer natural language questions based on the knowledge graph.
